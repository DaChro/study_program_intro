## Welcome

This website is intended to give you an introduction to the course structure of your studies and to help you plan your individual course program. At the beginning of the semester you will have to choose your courses and we offer an introduction meeting as well as personal advisory to help you do so. However, many of you usually arrive only very shortly before the start of lectures and often there is only very little time left for you to get to grips with the course structure and the choices you have. Thus, it is a good idea to start your planning before you arrive in Münster. This short introduction will help you do this so that when you arrive you already have an idea of which courses you will choose and know which open questions you need to ask.

The website consists of:

-   An overview of the program´s module structure
-   Brief descriptions of the modules of semesters 1 and 2 and the choice of courses
-   A brief description of the course booking system
-   A how-to for planning your personal course program
