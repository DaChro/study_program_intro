# Module structure

The total workload of the study program is 120 credit points (ECTS) distributed over 8 modules and 4 semesters. The third semester is reserved for doing an external semester (e.g., study abroad or conduct an internship) and in the fourth semester you will complete and defend your Master thesis. This means that the actual course program (lectures, seminars, study projects etc.) is completed in the first two semesters. Each semester is intended to contain \~30 ECTS, in total you will receive:

-   60 ECTS for courses (1st and 2nd semester)
-   30 ECTS for your external semester (3rd semester)
-   30 ECTS for writing and defending your Master thesis (4th semester)

This document is concerned with how to choose courses in order to collect the 60 ECTS in the first two semesters.

***Note:** Your course program in semester 1 and 2 consists of elective and **mandatory** courses. Most of these mandatory courses are only offered **once a year**. If you miss such a course, the next chance will be one year later, when you are supposed to do your external semester. This means that you have to choose mandatory courses in the semester when they are first offered to you, otherwise you risk a delay in your studies.*
